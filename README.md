# Greasy Fork脚本
I start an open-sourced project in Tempermonkey, which sounds so cool, isn't it?

I have been learning about Java in the atguigu, which is one of the most popular Java-Learning online courses in Bilibili.

A problem striked me that the titles of hundreds of episodes are incomplete when viewing a separate video in collection.

I try to find an appropriate method for adopting the size of every title in their line.

So I write a script in Tempermonkey to solve this problem.
